        "The \"Production / Capacity Planning and Value Stream Analysis\" script is focused on aiding production and capacity planning by performing value stream analysis. It analyzes images of production processes using optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text, enabling the assessment of value streams. The primary goal is to explore various scheduling algorithms and evaluate their performance concerning maximum capacity utilization. By leveraging image processing techniques and OCR, the script aims to provide insights into production efficiency, bottlenecks, and potential improvements. It serves as a valuable tool for optimizing resource allocation and enhancing overall productivity in manufacturing environments.\n",
